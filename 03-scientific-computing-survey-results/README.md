# Create a report of the results of the Scientific Computing Survey
- Explore the SCS: https://mikloskoren.typeform.com/to/t0uH7F
- Write a Python script to pull survey results from a Google Spreadsheet to a .csv file.
- Split responses to multiple choice questions in Python lists or other proper data formats.
- Create beautiful visualization of
	- distribution of software usage (most people use multiple software)
	- distribution of tool usage (most people use multiple tools)
	- gap between awareness (familiar with tool) and usage (used twice in the last month)
	- distribution of development goals
- Conduct multivariate/conditional analysis of the above by
	- field of research
	- year of Phd
- Select appropriate visualizations for these (not regression tables).
- Create a beautiful report. (Everything can be a single Jupyter notebook.)
